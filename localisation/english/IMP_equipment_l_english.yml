 honourifica_desc: "The 'Honourifica Imperium' encompasses a broad class of valour awards. These medals are presented in each segmentum; for example, this medal is known as 'Honourifica Obscura.' A holder of the Honourifica is a true hero of the Imperium, held in the highest regard by comrades and command alike."
 machariancross_desc: "The 'Macharian Cross' is highly valued among officers as it is awarded for the skilled application of 'Tactica Imperialis' principles. Bravery alone is insufficient for its attainment, and the bearer of this award is likely to be invited to the general staff for future campaigns and Crusades where their talents will be fully realized."
 crimson_desc: "Less prestigious than the 'Imperial Honours' but more common among Imperial Guard veterans, the 'Crimson Medallion' is awarded to soldiers who performed their duty despite severe injuries. Often, the medal holders have bionic prosthetics as a mark of their bravery, though most awards are posthumous."
 eagleordinary_desc: "Awarded to Imperial Guardsmen and other military personnel (Imperial Navy ranks, Medicae Officers, etc.) for valour exceeding standard requirements (although not considered exceptional). Medal holders jokingly refer to themselves as the regiment's 'boring heroes' because they survived. Nonetheless, those without the 'Order of the Ordinary Eagle' respect it as a symbol of courage."
 scarletwing_desc: "A lesser medal in the same category as the 'Order of the Eagle Claw,' the 'Scarlet Wing' signifies that its bearer was wounded but survived in battle while participating in an airborne assault. Wounds in such operations are common, so hardened assault troopers call receiving this medal 'earning your wings.'"
 wingedskull_desc: "The 'Winged Skull' is a traditional award of ancient origin. Classically depicted as an iron skull (also used by Adeptus Astartes as a sergeant insignia), it is usually displayed on the shoulder pads of armour and is awarded for inspiring leadership leading to a righteous victory."
 tripleskull_desc: "This medal is awarded to survivors of battles in which their units suffered losses of at least 66%. Unfortunately, several detachments of the 91st Cadian received this award for their valiant sacrifices in the Medusa V campaign. It is considered less honorable than the 'Golden Skull,' awarded posthumously to those who fell in such battles, though, undoubtedly, the recipients themselves hold it in high regard."
 ribbonintrinsic_desc: "The 'Order of the Ribbon' is a brass strip engraved with a three-part ribbon, awarded not to individual soldiers but to entire units. It is granted only to those detachments that held the line and turned a potential defeat into victory through sheer spirit. Despite its low material value, this award is believed to strengthen camaraderie within the unit and make it invincible. In practice, the 'Order of the Ribbon' is often awarded to a few surviving, battle-worn heroes who would prefer to forget those battles."
 meritofterra_desc: "The 'Merit of Terra' is awarded to Cadian soldiers who voluntarily postponed their demobilization. This award carries a bittersweet tone, as its bearer is obliged to serve longer than anticipated. Nevertheless, it is widely recognized as a symbol of steadfast loyalty to the Golden Throne. All Imperial military personnel respect those who wear the 'Merit of Terra,' and it is rumored that even the Adeptus Astartes acknowledge the diligence and selflessness it embodies."
 meritofthehighlords_desc: "The 'Merit of the High Lords' is a rare honor awarded to the greatest Cadian commanders, whose valor is so great that their name was mentioned in the Hall of the High Lords. The award has earned the nickname 'double-edged sword,' as receiving it inevitably means that from this point forward, the bearer will be under close scrutiny by command. He can expect assignments to the most horrific fronts, where he will have to impart his courage and wisdom, often at the envious direction of superiors."
 steelaquila_desc: "The 'Steel Aquila' is one of the most prestigious awards given to combat units. Represented by a golden hemisphere with a simple steel Imperial Eagle, it is often called the 'madman's eagle.' The medal is awarded to soldiers who, despite great personal danger, triumphed over the enemy and returned in a state fit for further service. This award is issued only for truly outstanding and fierce displays of personal valour."
 orderoftheeagleclaw_desc: "The 'Order of the Eagle Claw' is awarded to Cadian soldiers who landed in the most dangerous drop zones and emerged victorious. The award can only be earned by those who proved their resilience and success against overwhelming enemy superiority, under the observation of command or the Imperial Navy. Holders of the 'Order of the Eagle Claw' are especially respected by fleet personnel, regardless of their branch. Though typically intended for assault units, other units that participated in massive orbital landings under fire may also receive it. The 91st Cadian Regiment earned this distinguished award during the Medusa V campaign."
 knightofmedusa_desc: "A medal and honorary title awarded to Cadian officers of colonel rank and above who led their regiments in thirty or more days of continuous combat operations during the Medusa V campaign."
 medusanlaureate_desc: "An award established after the Medusan Schism, the 'Medusan Laureate' is awarded to Cadian soldiers who 'earned their laurels' in battle. Acts of valour leading to significant victories are marked by this insignia. Only soldiers granted this laurel are permitted to carry the banners of their unit or regiment."
 orderofthestorm_desc: "A combat badge awarded to Cadian soldiers who sustained injuries during the Medusan campaign and returned to the line. The 'Order of the Storm' depicts a pair of crossed lightning bolts above the Imperial Eagle. Receiving a 'double storm' or 'triple storm' signifies a soldier wounded multiple times, considered especially lucky (as they are still alive)."
 crimsonskull_desc: "Most commonly seen among the Cadian Medicae Office staff, this medal is adorned with a solitary crimson ruby. The 'Crimson Skull' is awarded to soldiers who, while directly in combat, successfully provided medical aid to the wounded. Experienced field medics always wear this award, but particularly brave soldiers who saved the lives of their injured comrades can also earn it."
 valorisimperator_desc: "In the form of a soaring two-headed eagle, the 'Imperial Valor' is awarded only to those who have served in the Cadian Shock Troops regiments for twenty years or more. Technically, it is a long-service award, but in practice, it is always awarded posthumously to veterans who served under particularly harsh conditions."
 administratummedal_desc: "Depicting a scroll coiled around a solitary skull, the 'Medal of the Administratum' is awarded to those Cadian soldiers who fought to protect the personnel or property of this venerable body."
 medusastar_desc: "The 'Medusa Star' is a general medal of the Imperial Guard, marking participation in combat during the Medusa V campaign. It was awarded to all Cadian servicemen, with officers receiving a gold version. It is the most basic award a guardsman could earn for participating in this campaign and holds little value, except for those soldiers who recently transferred into the regiment."
