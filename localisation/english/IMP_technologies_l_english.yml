 imp_armor_tech_1: "Basic Armor Protection"
 imp_armor_tech_1_desc: "Tanks during the Great War only had to contend with enemy small arms. As such, they got away with fairly thin armor. A new generation of anti-tank weaponry has made the battlefield a much more dangerous place for a tank, and much heavier protection is needed."
 imp_armor_tech_2: "Improved Armor Protection"
 imp_armor_tech_2_desc: "With heavier and heavier anti-tank weapons being fielded around the world, the next generation of tanks will require even better protection."
 imp_armor_tech_3: "Advanced Armor Protection"
 imp_armor_tech_3_desc: "While the limit of deployed anti-tank guns has likely been reached, a new generation of tanks will carry more advanced weaponry, which is able to pierce any current level of protection at long range."
 imp_armor_tech_4: "Modern Armor Protection"
 imp_armor_tech_4_desc: "During the war, the threats faced by tanks have multiplied, from enemy tanks, anti-tank guns, dedicated tank destroyers, all the way to modern infantry weapons firing shaped charges that can penetrate even heavy armor. We must develop new protection methods to keep our own tanks alive in the face of these threats."
 imp_engine_tech_1: "Basic Engine"

 imp_engine_tech_3: "Advanced Engine"
 imp_engine_tech_3_desc: "Mechanized warfare is a form of combat that requires fast decision making and fast movement of troops and supplies. If our tanks are to carry modern weapons and enough armor to survive on the battlefield, they require powerful engines to keep up with the motorized infantry."
 imp_engine_tech_4: "Modern Engine"
 imp_engine_tech_4_desc: "The numerous new additions to tanks made necessary by modern warfare have increased the weight of the vehicle substantially. To move all that mass around, we require engines that have a lot of power behind them."
