 IMP_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "In the 30th millennium, during the Great Crusade, the Emperor of Mankind and his retinue were caught in a Warp anomaly. Transported to the year 1936, they found themselves in Tibet, on the eve of World War II. Now, the Emperor must unite humanity of this era, using the power and technology of the Imperium to prepare Earth for the impending threats and decide whether to take the path of diplomacy or war."

#### Events
 imperium.1: "Unexpected Twist of Fate"
 imperium.1.t: "Unexpected Twist of Fate"
 imperium.1.d: "My plans to unite humanity were proceeding as expected. I was aboard the flagship 'Emperor Somnium,' accompanied by my loyal Custodes and the wise Malcador the Sigillite. We were returning from a successful campaign to liberate another world from xenos and heretics.\nHowever, in the midst of our journey through the Warp, I felt a powerful distortion in its currents. It was an anomaly of such magnitude that I had not encountered in all my millennia. The Warp boiled and churned, as if warning of an impending catastrophe. I tried to stabilize the situation, channeling my psychic energy to calm the Warp storms, but the forces were too great.\nSuddenly, the ship trembled, the instruments malfunctioned, and chaos erupted around us. I heard the voices of my Custodes, issuing orders and trying to maintain control of the situation. Malcador stood beside me, his face reflecting focus and determination.\n'We must prepare for the unknown,' I said. 'Gather everyone and make sure we are ready for whatever consequences may come.'\nMoments later, a blinding flash of light filled everything. I felt space and time shift, as reality itself bent under the influence of the anomaly. We were cast into the unknown.\nWhen the light subsided, I opened my eyes to see an unfamiliar world. Snow-covered mountains stretched toward the sky, and a cold wind blew through our surroundings. We were no longer aboard the ship—we had landed on the surface of a planet that seemed both familiar and alien.\n'Where are we?' Malcador asked, looking around.\n'I don’t know, my friend,' I replied. 'But this place is full of energy and potential. Perhaps fate has brought us here for a reason.'\nI sensed the presence of humans nearby—their thoughts were like an open book. This world needs guidance, and perhaps our mission to unite humanity must start here, in this very place."
 imperium.1.a: "We will accept this challenge and continue our mission here."
 imperium.2: "Mysterious Appearance in the Himalayas"
 imperium.2.t: "Mysterious Appearance in the Himalayas"
 imperium.2.d: "In the cold and impassable peaks of the Himalayas, something incredible has happened. Monks from a remote monastery report the sudden appearance of mysterious beings clad in golden armor, accompanying a majestic man with an aura of unmatched power. Their arrival was marked by a bright flash of light and a powerful surge of energy that was felt for miles around.\nLocal residents watch in fear and awe, unsure if these newcomers are gods or demons. The leader of Tibet and the country's spiritual leaders are alarmed and seek to understand the nature of this phenomenon.\nMeanwhile, the mysterious visitors have begun exploring the surroundings, displaying technology and abilities far beyond anything humanity has ever seen. The world is on the verge of great change, and no one knows what the future holds with the arrival of these enigmatic strangers."
 imperium.2.a: "Observe the unfolding events."
 imperium.3: "A New Era Begins"
 imperium.3.t: "A New Era Begins"
 imperium.3.d: "I opened my eyes and felt the cold wind of the Himalayas cutting through my cloak. The Warp had brought us to this unexplored world, and my loyal Custodes stood around me, ready for any trial. Malcador was beside me, his gaze fixed on the distant snow-covered peaks.\nWe found ourselves in a place that reminded me of a distant past, a time when humanity was just beginning its journey. This world is full of potential power, but also threats. I can feel the thoughts of the locals—fear, wonder, hope. They do not know who we are, but they will soon learn.\nIt is time to act. I must establish contact with the leaders of this region, understand their culture and customs. With my psychic abilities, I will reach out to their ruler and convince him not to resist our arrival. We will bring enlightenment and unity to this world, free it from superstition and discord.\nMy first task will be to establish a base from which we can launch our mission. I order the Custodes to begin setting up a camp and prepare for further operations. A long journey lies ahead, but I believe that together we can lead humanity to a new Golden Age."
 imperium.3.a: "So it shall be."
 imperium.4: "Exploring the Surroundings"
 imperium.4.t: "Exploring the Surroundings"
 imperium.4.d: "Having arrived in an unfamiliar world, the Emperor understands the need to gather as much information as possible about the land and its inhabitants. Despite his psychic abilities, a detailed understanding of the environment and potential threats requires a more practical approach.\nHe summons Constantin Valdor, Captain-General of the Adeptus Custodes.\n'Valdor, we need to learn more about this place. Send squads of Custodes to explore the surroundings. Let them act cautiously and avoid unnecessary contact with the locals. We need maps of the area, information on the population, resources, and potential threats.'\nValdor nodded: 'So it shall be, my lord. We will begin immediately.'\nMalcador the Sigillite, standing nearby, added: 'This is a wise decision. Knowledge is power, and in this world, we will need all the information we can gather to successfully continue our mission.'"
 imperium.4.a: "Send the Custodes to scout."
 imperium.5: "Reconnaissance Report"
 imperium.5.t: "Reconnaissance Report"
 imperium.5.d: "Several days later, the Custodes return from their reconnaissance. Constantin Valdor personally reports the findings to the Emperor.\n'My lord, we have surveyed the surrounding area within a radius of several hundred kilometers. Here are our key findings:\nThe terrain is mostly mountainous, with high peaks and deep valleys. The weather is cold and unpredictable, which could hinder the movement of large forces.\nWe found several small settlements. The local population lives in simple communities, practicing agriculture and livestock breeding. Their technology is primitive, relying mostly on manual labor.\nThey have strong religious beliefs and practices. They worship various gods and spirits. We observed several monasteries and temples atop the mountains.\nThe region's resources are limited, but we detected signs of mineral deposits, including iron and rare metals. There is potential for resource extraction and industrial development.\nBeyond this region are larger states with more developed infrastructure and military forces. They could pose both a potential threat and an opportunity for expanding our influence.'\nMalcador listens carefully and then says: 'This knowledge will be invaluable for our future plans. It may be wise to begin by establishing control over this region, using both our strength and the power of persuasion.'\nThe Emperor ponders the report, weighing the options for future actions."
 imperium.5.a: "Be prepared."
 imperium.6: "Council of Three"
 imperium.6.t: "Council of Three"
 imperium.6.d: "After receiving Constantin Valdor’s report on the reconnaissance, the Emperor convenes a council with Malcador the Sigillite and the Captain-General of the Custodes. In the shadow of towering mountains, within their temporary camp, they gather around a table covered with maps and information about the surrounding lands.\nThe Emperor, thoughtfully gazing at the map, speaks:\n'This world is full of potential, but also dangers. The local population does not pose an immediate threat, but their religious beliefs and outdated customs could become obstacles to progress. We must decide how to proceed.'\nMalcador nods: 'My lord, we could use your psychic abilities to persuade the leaders of Tibet to join us peacefully. This would avoid unnecessary bloodshed and accelerate the process of integration.'\nConstantin Valdor adds: 'However, there is a risk that not everyone will submit without resistance. Military conquest would ensure full control and demonstrate our strength, but it might provoke resistance and undermine the trust of the local population.'\nThe Emperor responds thoughtfully: 'Both paths have their advantages and risks. Our mission is to unite humanity and lead it to a brighter future. We must choose the right method to achieve this goal here and now.'"

 imperium.9.t: "Retreat after Conflict with Shanxi"
 imperium.9.d: "Contrary to expectations, Shanxi's forces were prepared for defense, and the Imperium had to retreat to preserve its forces. However, the Emperor does not forgive such defeats, and we will repay this insult. The only question is when the next strike will be delivered."
